# JavaFXTextAdventure
Template for a rich text adventure game with format similar to the telnet MUD applications

This project was build in Java SDK 11 with Java FX 11 in Intellij. The intent was to develop an application for a text-based adventure game that looks similar to a Telnet MUD. It is essentially a scrolling pane that displays text as it is generated, from actions generated from the input field from the player. It uses TextFlow to display the text, which supports multiple colors, styles, and unicode for a text-rich environment.

The code is clunky and not very elegant, but does the job to set up an environment to program a text-based environemnt. Anyone is welcome to clean up the code and update it.
